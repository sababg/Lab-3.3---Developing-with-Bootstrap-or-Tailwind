## Reflection Questions

1: I used Tailwind, and it takes time to create reusable classes.

2: With the help of utility classes and the reusable custom classes, it was easier to style code instead of using a CSS file.

3: Actually, I am a big fan of Tailwind, and if I do not have permission to use Tailwind in a project, I will use MUI or ShadCn.
