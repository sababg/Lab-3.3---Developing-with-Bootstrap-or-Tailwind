## Reflection Questions

1: Figma allowed me to see exact design specifications such as color values, font styles, font sizes, margins, and padding, which helped me translate the design into code more accurately. Having precise measurements reduced guesswork and ensured consistency between the design and the final implementation.

2: In this example nothing especial.

3: It was already a great help
